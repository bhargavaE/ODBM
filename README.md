# ODBM
odbm api call with python3
This program will generate ODBMapi outpot on the console
API key has to be generated from the website at the first place
I have imported requests and pprint to get the pretty output on the console.
I have assigned "r" for the API key.
When you successfully execute the program the console output will be the desired moviename details.
